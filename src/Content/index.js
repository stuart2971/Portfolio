                    Back in my early teenage years, at the age of 13, I embarked
                    on a self-taught journey into the world of programming and
                    web development. Fueled by curiosity and a passion for
                    creating digital experiences, I delved headfirst into
                    coding, exploring the intricacies of web technologies. Over
                    the years, this journey has taken me through diverse
                    professional landscapes, from contributing to an eDiscovery
                    platform and a real estate platform to working as a
                    freelance developer.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Currently, I find myself navigating the dynamic intersection
                    of academia and technology, as I dedicate my time to
                    completing my final year of school. Amidst the academic
                    challenges, my primary focus remains on honing my skills and
                    expanding my knowledge in web development.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    In my free time, I channel my creativity into crafting
                    web-based projects, finding joy in the process of bringing
                    ideas to life online. Beyond the realm of coding, you'll
                    often find me in the gym, passionately preparing for
                    powerlifting competitions. Cooking up my favorite meals is
                    another cherished pastime, offering a delicious balance to
                    the digital endeavors that define my professional and
                    personal journey.
